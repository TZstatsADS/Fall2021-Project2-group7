+ **Project summary**: Since COVID-19 vaccines became available to all New York residents 16 and over [beginning April 6](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-new-yorkers-30-years-age-and-older-will-be-eligible-receive-covid-19), many parts of the life in the city is seeming to return to Pre-Covid. We believe that new mask regulations and decisions regarding reopening of restaurants and other cultural activities in New York are based on statistics of COVID cases. So, in our app we look at how COVID-19 has impacted out lives in terms of statistics. Plus, a useful map to locate resources in New York.
